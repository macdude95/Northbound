# Future Features

## 1. More Rigorous Testing

- Ability to define various ranges to test over (i.e. over the last 10 years, from 5 years ago to 1 year ago, etc)

## 2. Next-Day Allocation Simulation

- Ability to backtest/simulate and get daily allocations closer to how the strategy is actually used
- Execute trades the morning after rather than buying right at the end of the day
- Current price integration: moving averages/indicators should incorporate current price (today's close or opening)

## 3. Automated Trading

- Integration with trading APIs (Alpaca, Fidelity, Robinhood)
- Automatic execution of portfolio rebalancing based on daily allocations
- Trade execution monitoring and reporting
